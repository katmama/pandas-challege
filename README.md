Here are the instructions for my Pandas Challenge Homework:

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. Your latest role is Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

I will admit, in the beginning I used multiple steps in my calcualtions that could have been reduced and I finally did so by the last several dataframe creations. 

**Here is my Analysis:**
  1. Overall, charter schools perfmored better than district schools
  2. There is an inverse relationship between Spend Per Student and Performance.  The performance scores were higher where the spend per student was less.
  3. Scores were stagnant across all 4 grades, showing very little improvement.
